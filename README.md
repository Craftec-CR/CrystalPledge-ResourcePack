# Craftec Resource Pack
## How to build:
- In order to build the resource pack, you must first install 7-zip: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html
- Then, add the directory where 7-zip is installed to your system's PATH variable.
- Now you can run build.bat!

For convenience, and fast reloading in Minecraft (Using F3+T), the batch file will generate a folder resourcepack in your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder, as well as a Craftec.zip file inside the repo.
