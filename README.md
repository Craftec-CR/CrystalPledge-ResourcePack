# Craftec Resource Pack
## How to build:
(Requires to have 7zip installed)
- Clone this repository into a folder in .minecraft/resourcepacks. The folder name must be different from "Craftec"
- Run build.bat

For fast reloading in Minecraft (Using F3+T), this will generate a folder resourcepack in the resourcepacks folder, as well as a Craftec.zip inside the repo
