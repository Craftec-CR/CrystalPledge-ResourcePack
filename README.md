# Crystal Pledge Resource Pack
## How to build:
In order to build the resource pack, place the builder jar file in the source folder (next to pack.mcmeta), and execute it.

For convenience and fast reloading in-game (Using F3+T), the builder will generate a folder resourcepack in your .minecraft/resourcepacks folder, aside from a zip file inside the source folder.
